                    <div class="section-paragraph">
                        <p>In April of 2008, just one day after my 24th birthday, I jetted off to Dublin, Ireland to
                            start what would be my first solo backpacking trip through Europe.</p>
                        <p>I spent 3 months bouncing around the continent and being the absolute newbie of a
                            traveler that I was at the time, I ended up blowing $10,000 dollars over the course of
                            the trip.Yeah, I know. I definitely blew some serious cash. But, I also learned a lot in
                            the process.</p>
                        <p>A lot about myself. A lot about others. A lot about travel. And, well, a lot about life
                            in general.While my first big backpacking trip ended up costing me a pretty penny, I had
                            no idea that the experience would be one that would change my life forever.</p>
                        <p>You see, I met a lot of people during those three months.A lot of people who inspired me.

                    <div class="section-paragraph">
                        <p>You know how they say there&rsquo;s always a guy that&rsquo;s stronger, faster, and
                            tougher than you? It&rsquo;s true.Maybe not in the literal sense of the phrase but
                            I&rsquo;ll tell you, I really thought I was the coolest guy on Earth because I was
                            spending 3 months backpacking around Europe.</p>
                        <p>That was until I met people that had been on the road for years. Meeting these people
                            from all walks of life that were continually traveling was not only incredibly inspiring
                            for me but also pretty mind blowing at the same time.</p>
                        <p>With that, I left Europe wanting more.After returning home and settling back into the rat
                            race, everyday that passed seemed to be in slow motion.</p>
                        <p>I knew what I wanted. I wanted to take another trip of a lifetime. Only this time I would
                            tackle the world.</p>
